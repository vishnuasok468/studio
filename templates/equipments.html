            <h3>Sony A7</h3>
            <p>The Sony a7 IV is the best camera for photography that we've tested. It's a very well-rounded hybrid
                model that sits just shy of pro territory. With a new, higher-resolution 33 MP sensor over its
                predecessor—the highly popular Sony a7 III—it captures highly detailed photos with plenty of leeway to
                crop and make edits. Dynamic range is excellent, and Sony's real-time autofocus continues to set the
                standard for what AF is capable of.</p>

            <h3>Canon EOS 5D Mark IV</h3>
            <p>The Canon EOS 5D Mark IV is a professional-grade 30.1-megapixel full-frame digital single-lens reflex
                (DSLR) camera made by Canon.Succeeding the EOS 5D Mark III, it was announced on 25 August 2016. The Mark
                IV went on sale in
                September 2016 with a retail price of $3,499 in the US, £3,599 in the UK, and €4,129 in the Eurozone. As
                Canon is phasing out its entire DSLR lineup[citation needed], this is the final model in the EOS 5D
                series[citation needed] and has effectively been succeeded by the EOS R5 mirrorless camera.</p>
